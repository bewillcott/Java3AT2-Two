# Java3 AT2 Question 2
This is a TAFE assignment for the Diploma in Software Development, at the South Metropolitan TAFE,
Rockingham, Western Australia.

The project task is to develop a mechanical parts list,
to use at Jupiter Mining Corporation (a fake business entity).

A balanced binary search tree (BBST) needs to be created/developed, for a dictionary
of no less than 10 words.  It must be possible to search the list, and add
and remove from the list.

## Implementation
This project consists of 1 sub-project within the aggregator project:

- Common

**Note:** This is a work-in-progress.  It is expected that there will be at least one, and possibly
two more projects to be added.

### Common
This is a non-executable jar, containing a collection of classes that are in 'common' use across 
multiple projects.  It contains the Balanced Binary Search Tree (BBST): `AvlTree<T>`.
